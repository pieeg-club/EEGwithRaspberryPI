Actual locations for the scripts will be [here](https://github.com/pieeg-club/PiEEG) , now just only Python.


### To Buy - PiEEG is available in the market at our partner shop [Elecrow](https://pieeg.com/pieeg/)

This project is the result of several years of work on the development of BCI. We believe that the easiest way to get started with biosignals is to use a shield.
We will try to reveal the process of reading EEG signals as fully and clearly as possible. 

### GUI
PiEEG it is a low-cost brain-computer interface that allows measuring EEG via RaspberryPI

Connect the shield to Raspberry Pi which is supplied via a 5V battery (power supply) and connect electrodes.
Full galvanic isolation from mains is required.  
This also applies to the monitor. Use only a monitor that is powered by the Raspberry Pi, as in the picture below, left. Electrodes are positioned according to the International 10-20 system, right
