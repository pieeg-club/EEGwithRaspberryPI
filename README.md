# Software from this rep Not supported more. Actual scripts will be [here](https://github.com/pieeg-club/PiEEG) , now just only Python. It is a old version with C language.    


# To Buy - PiEEG is available in the market at our partner shop [Elecrow](https://pieeg.com/pieeg/)

This project is the result of several years of work on the development of BCI. We believe that the easiest way to get started with biosignals is to use a shield.
We will try to reveal the process of reading EEG signals as fully and clearly as possible.

Connect the shield to Raspberry Pi 3 or Raspberry Pi 4 and after that connect the device to a battery (power supply) and connect electrodes.
Full galvanic isolation from mains required.  
This also applies to the monitor. Use only a monitor that is powered by the Raspberry Pi, as in the picture below, left. Electrodes positioned according to the International 10-20 system, right.

#### Device Pinout  
Shield connected with Raspberry Pi only at the next points:     
  43  +5V  
  44  GND  
  37  MOSI  
  34  MISO  
  35  CLK  
  36  CS  

  
#### Description of Code  
Python script does not allow reading data from ADS1299 with a frequency of 250 Hz. It's necessary to use .c or .cpp scripts for reading data in real-time and Python for signal processing and visualization.
